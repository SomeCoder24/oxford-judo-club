  - Tony Buley (2nd Dan)

  All three hold Level 3 coaching certificates (including first aid certificates) awarded by the BJA. In addition James Birnie, 4th Dan holds a BJA Level 2 BJA coaching certificate.

The responsibility for this lies with the Committee of OUJC who should always acquire a copy of the visitor's licence in advance of the session as a check.

- **5.4** Coaches who do not hold BJA licences or licences not recognised by the BJA for  insurance purposes (e.g. visiting coaches from another country) are required to prove to the OUJC Committee that they have valid public liability insurance cover at the level required by the University Sports Department before taking a training session.
