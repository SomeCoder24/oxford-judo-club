**Risk Assessments**

1. All club activities are appropriately risk assessed by the club. The club maintains up to date and accurate records of its risk assessments, so they can be immediately referred to should an accident, incident or near-miss occur. The clubs also maintain records of any changes made to those risk assessments (including the dates any changes were made) to be referred to as and when required. Support with conducting risk assessments can be requested through the Sports Safety Officer, who will also review all clubs' risk assessments periodically and provide feedback.
1. Risk assessments for regular club activities are included as appendices to this policy, which will be updated when changes are required. Such risk assessments are reviewed at least once every 12 months (e.g. during the handover process or before the start of a new academic year).
2. Risk assessments for events are submitted via the event registration process to be approved by the Sports Safety Officer. All details are submitted at least 21 days prior to the event, as per regulation 1.12(2) of the [University Regulations for the Activities and Conduct of Student Members](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/rules-committee-regulations-1-of-2017), which is reiterated in the club's constitution.
3. Risk assessments for trips and tours (UK or abroad) are submitted via the trip and tour registration process to be approved by the Sports Safety Officer. All details are submitted at least one calendar month prior to departure, as per regulation 4.2 of the [University Regulations for the Activities and Conduct of Student Members](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/rules-committee-regulations-1-of-2017), which is reiterated in the club's constitution.
2. For risk assessment purposes, club activities include any activity organised by the club or its committee member for the benefit of the club's members, or any activities using the club's resources or name. Activities or events organised between members of the club are not included, providing the club and/or committee is not involved in organising the activities and the club does not provide its resources or name in the organising of the activities.

**First Aid**

1. All club activities are appropriately covered by qualified first aiders, unless the risk assessment for the activity explicitly states that first aid cover is not required.

1. This cover comes in a variety of forms (such as qualified staff at host venues, qualified coaches leading activity, qualified club members within activity, emergency services or externally appointed first aiders) and will be specified in the risk assessment for each activity.
2. Should the agreed first aid provision not be available, the risks are reassessed using guidance from the National Governing Body and the Sports Safety Officer. If following re-assessment, the activity cannot go ahead safely, then the club will cancel that planned activity.

**Accidents, Emergencies and Near Misses**

1. All accidents, emergencies and near misses that take place during club activities are logged by the club and reported to the University via [the Health & Safety Incident Reporting Form](https://oxforduni-remoteforms.info-exchange.com/Incident), which is required by health and safety law, to ensure that the club is maintaining a duty of care to its members. All reported accidents, incidents and near-misses will be reviewed by the Sports Safety Officer.
1. An 'accident' is defined as an unfortunate incident that happened unexpectedly and unintentionally resulting in injury to a person or persons and/or damage to property.

1. An 'incident' is used to encompass accidents, dangerous occurrences, specified occupational exposure, ill-health. All accidents, emergencies and near misses that take place during club activities are logged by the club and reported to the University via [in the Health & Safety Incident Reporting Form](https://oxforduni-remoteforms.info-exchange.com/Incident), which is required by health and safety law, to ensure that the club is maintaining a duty of care to its members.
2. A 'near-miss' relates to incidents that did not result in injury, illness, or damage, but that had the potential to do so. Recognising and reporting these incidents can provide opportunities to learn lessons that prevent future injury or damage. Club members and committees are actively encouraged to report near misses without fear of blame, to ensure safety is improved for any future or repeat issues.

**Insurance**

1. All club activities are appropriately insured to ensure that the members, and the club itself, have an appropriate level of cover should an accident or incident occur.
1. The club has public liability insurance, which is provided by [name of insurance provider or NGB] and a copy of this insurance can be provided to members or third parties when needed.
2. The club has personal accident insurance, which is provided by [name of insurance provider or NGB] and a copy of this insurance can be provided to members when needed. All registered club members (registered through the Sports Federation membership process) are also covered by the Sports Federation personal accident insurance. This policy should be treated as a backup for club specific cover, but details of this policy will be communicated directly to members once they are registered by the club.
3. The club ensures that all coaches and session leaders have appropriate professional liability cover in place and always maintains up to date records of those insurance details.

**Coaching**

  1. Any sports coaching that takes place within club activities is led by individuals with appropriate qualifications and insurance in place. Coaching is defined as the process of motivating, guiding, and providing technical advice or training to individual(s) or teams, relating to the sport or activity in question.
  2. Coaching can come in a variety of forms. This requirement includes external contracted instructors or coaches (whether permanent or visiting), club members, student leaders and volunteers, who all must have the correct qualifications and insurance in place.
  3. Volunteer instructors or coaches can, in some circumstances, have insurance cover through the sports NGB without having a qualification, but any insurance in place must still be clarified and evidenced and the club will maintain up to date records of those insurance details.

  1. All individuals that are 'coaching' within club activities are registered with the Sports Federation though the Club Coach Registration Form, as per regulation 1.12(1)(k) of the [University Regulations for the Activities and Conduct of Student Members](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/rules-committee-regulations-1-of-2017).
  1. The club acknowledges that failure to register coaches through the Club Coach Registration Form, or failure to include any coach's qualifications or insurance, may expose club officers, the club and the University to damages arising out of negligent action by the coach, and as such will ensure all coaches are registered appropriately.

**Events**

1. All events organised by the club are planned, organised and risk assessed in a thorough manner.

1. 'Club events' are defined as any activities that take place on a specific date(s) or at a specific time(s) that are outside of the club's regular risk assessed activity, which can include sporting and non-sporting activities. Further details can be found via the Events page of the Sports Federation Hub.
2. All club events are submitted via the Event Registration Process, to be approved by the Sports Safety Officer. All details are submitted at least 21 days before the event is due to take place, as per regulation 1.12(2) of the [University Regulations for the Activities and Conduct of Student Members](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/rules-committee-regulations-1-of-2017).
3. The club acknowledges that failure to register any event within the above deadline may mean that said event cannot be approved and therefore cannot take place.

1. Club social events and activities are also appropriately planned, organised and risk assessed, but in most cases will not be registered via the Event Registration Process, unless they are associated with or linked directly to a sporting event (e.g. an after-event dinner).

1. Club social activities are defined as any non-sporting activity organised by the club or its committee members for the benefit of the club's members, or any activities using the club's resources or name. Social activities or events organised between members of the club are not included, providing the club and/or committee are not involved in organising the activities and the club does not provide its resources or name in the organising of the activities.

**Trips and Tours**

1. All trips and tours organised by the club are planned, organised and risk assessed in a thorough manner.
1. 'Trips and Tours' are defined as any club activity that requires an overnight stay or any activity outside of Oxford for those sports deemed as 'higher risk'.Further details can be found via the Trips and Tours page on the Sports Federation Hub.
2. All club trips and tours are submitted via the Trips and Tours Registration Process to be approved by the Sports Safety Officer. All details are submitted before the club makes any firm commitments, and at least one month before the trip or tour is due to take place, as per regulation 4.2 of the [University Regulations for the Activities and Conduct of Student Members](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/rules-committee-regulations-1-of-2017).
3. All club overseas trips will also follow all of Part 4 of the [University Regulations for the Activities and Conduct of Student Members](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/rules-committee-regulations-1-of-2017), which includes individual permission requirements for each student (through the Sports Safety Officer and the Proctors) should the trip take place during Full Term or the Thursday and Friday preceding Full Term. The club is aware that permission for students to travel within these timescales is not guaranteed and the club will make alternative arrangements if permission is not granted (e.g. change of dates) otherwise the trip or tour will be unable to take place.
4. The club, the individuals and any club property travelling should not be uninsured during any part of a trip, as comprehensive travel insurance is a requirement for all participants travelling on a club's overseas trip.
5. The club acknowledges that failure to register any trip or tour within the above deadline may mean that said trip or tour cannot be approved or take place, either at all or at least in the name of the University.

**Safeguarding Children and Vulnerable Adults**

1. Club activities that bring (or may bring) members into contact with children under 18, or anyone defined as a vulnerable adult, are separately risk assessed and approved by the Sports Safeguarding Officer.
1. Any concerns regarding safeguarding are to be addressed to the club committees and the club ensures that every club member knows how to escalate concerns to the committee.
2. Any concerns brought to the committee are shared with the Sports Safeguarding Officer (SSO), as early as possible, who may refer to the University Designated Leads for a decision and action if required. Concerns should not be reported to the club's NGB until the University Designated Leads has provided feedback to the Sports Safeguarding Officer.
3. Any risk assessments or concerns shared with the Sports Safeguarding Officer should be sent only via [safety@sport.ox.ac.uk](mailto:safety@sport.ox.ac.uk) for confidentiality purposes.
