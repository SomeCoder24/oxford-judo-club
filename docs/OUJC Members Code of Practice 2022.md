# Oxford Judo

## Code of Practice for Members

## Introduction

**This Code of Practice** establishes the rules and guidelines governing the day to day activities of the constituent clubs of Oxford Judo and is to be observed by club members and any visitors using the facilities provided by the OU Sports Department. Its prime purpose is to ensure that Judo can be practised enjoyably and with confidence in an environment which ensures the highest possible standards of health safety and hygiene and which meets the requirements of the University of Oxford's [Health and Safety policy](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/SPRT-ClubSupportResources/SitePages/Health-%26-Safety-and-Covid-19-Guidance.aspx). A copy will be provided annually to every member of both clubs and on joining. It will also be accessible on the [Oxford Judo website](http://www.oxfordjudo.com/). Members are expected to be familiar with its contents and to abide by them.

**The aims of Oxford Judo** are an amalgamation of those set out in the constitutions of the two clubs, available on the [Oxford Judo website](http://www.oxfordjudo.com/).

**Training sessions** are structured to serve the separate needs of three groups of members viz:

- Experienced players who wish to participate competitively at BUCS, BJA Regional, national, or international level.
- Intermediate level members who have no strong competitive ambitions but enjoy the sport and its cultural associations and find it an excellent form of physical and mental recreation.
- Complete beginners and 'rejoiners' for whom special training sessions are held weekly in the Michaelmas term run by one of the Senior Club Coaches supported by members.

### Instruction And Coaching

Training and practice sessions take place up to five times weekly during term time and somewhat less frequently during vacations. Sessions are run by one or other of the club coaches. **No club practice shall take place in the absence of a recognised qualified coach or instructor.**

In accordance with University regulations and BJA insurance policy requirements, all Oxford Judo coaches and instructors must hold a current BJA licence and coaching certificate of the BJA or of an equivalent body recognised by the International Judo Federation linked to adequate professional indemnity and public liability insurance.

### Mixed Practice sessions

By observing the code, it is not deemed necessary (other than in full contest or *shiai*) to place any restrictions of grade, gender, or age difference on those who practice together under the watchful eye of a session instructor.

### Use of Judo Techniques outside the Dojo

It is a requirement of club membership that Judo techniques and skills shall not be applied outside the dojo except where there is a need for self-protection or the protection of others and then only with the minimum level of force required.

### Failure to Observe the Code

Anyone who fails to observe the code may be required to leave the mat area by the instructor and, at the discretion of the Oxford Judo Committee, may be banned from the dojo and from further membership.

## Judo values and etiquette

It is expected that members and visitors alike will be aware of and conform to the spirit, values and courtesies laid down by Judo's founder, Professor Jigoro Kano. Above all is the value of mutual respect shown by practitioners to each other irrespective of grade.

- All formal club sessions shall commence with a formal (kneeling) bow between the session instructors and all other members.
- Permission must be sought from the session coach before entering or leaving the mat area while a session is in progress.
- Every practice, however informal, is commenced and ended with a standing bow.
- In practice sessions, the senior grade should always take responsibility for the welfare and the skill development of his or her less experienced or physically weaker practice partner to ensure that only safe skilful throws and breakfalls should be attempted and that the thrower exercises good control
- Reckless, excessively heavy throws, or the over-energetic or sudden application of armlocks or strangleholds must be strictly avoided.
- Advanced techniques such as maki-komi and sacrifice throws must only be attempted during practice by senior grades (blue belt and above) on those whom they know to have practised being thrown in this way.
- In groundwork, excessive use of strength should be avoided; techniques must be terminated at the first indication of a submission (or even before if the attacker (*tori*) has any suspicion that the defender (*uke*) is not in a position to respond).
- In non-competitive free practice, excessively defensive postures and tactics should be avoided and junior grades should be encouraged to attempt as many techniques as possible, following them through to a successful conclusion.

### Health and safety

When practised properly in accordance with its code of etiquette and values, judo is a very safe sport and serious injury is extremely rare. To support this concern for safety, the club carries out, annually, a health and safety risk assessment for protection of participants and others who may be involved in training or competitive activities or as spectators (see OJ website, [Health and Safety page](http://www.oxfordjudo.com/club/health-and-safety/)).

Club members must be mindful of health and safety considerations at all times and exercise a duty of care to all other members and visitors. In particular the following points must be noted and observed:

- A basic first aid kit shall always be available in the dojo.
- All participants are required to be aware of and to avoid the use of prohibited acts as stipulated in the rules of contest judo.
- All participants with any form of medical condition should make the coach/instructor aware of this at the beginning of the session.
- Every training session shall commence with a thorough warm-up session and finish with a cool-down (late-comers will not be allowed to participate in any form of judo practice until the instructor judges that they have completed a thorough warm-up).
- All beginners must learn to breakfall and be assessed as competent by a qualified coach before practising other judo techniques.
- In the event of participants receiving cuts or abrasions, any traces of blood must be removed from the mat using the antiseptic solution or wipes provided.
- Participants must immediately obey the instructions of the instructor or referee to cease any manoeuvre which may be risking possible injury to themselves or others.
- The number of people practising on the mat any time must always be strictly controlled by the instructor. Typically, this should not exceed three pairs in standing randori or seven pairs in groundwork. These numbers do not apply during the use of the large mat area in the main sports hall and may also be exceeded for formal instruction or uchi-komi practice at the discretion of the instructor/coach in charge of the session.
- All spectators and those not currently engaged in practice on the mat, should, where possible, sit on the seats provided and under no circumstances sit with legs outstretched or knees pointing upwards on the edge of the mat area.
- Under no circumstances will the use of non-prescribed drugs or alcohol be accepted prior to or during training sessions.

### Accident procedures

- Should any form of accident or injury occur, the practice session must be suspended by the instructor until its seriousness has been assessed and, if appropriate, the injured person has been assisted to leave the mat.
- In the case of unconsciousness or suspected injury to the neck or spine an ambulance should be called by a Sports Department member. If injury to neck or spine is suspected, no attempt should be made to move the person (if absolutely essential to assist breathing remedial action must be taken under the supervision of a suitably trained and experienced first-aider).
- Any injury requiring any form of first aid or medical attention, or which subsequently proves to require such, must be to the Sports Centre administration desk (the BJA must also be informed of such "reportable accidents").

### Facilities and equipment

#### Dress, Equipment and Personal Hygiene

- With the exception of complete beginners, members are required to wear judogi (conforming with the BJA guidelines) and belts which indicate their BJA or equivalent grade.
- Members should maintain a high standard of personal hygiene at all times. Judogi must be regularly washed, feet should be kept clean and fingers and toe nails kept short and regularly trimmed.
- No hard objects should be worn on the mat by anyone (including the coach); jewellery and watches should be removed, and hair tied back.
- Special equipment such as crash mats or training weapons may only be used with the authority and under the guidance of a qualified instructor.

#### Use of Dojo and Mats

- No member shall enter the dojo without the authority of an Oxford Judo coach or a member of the Sports Centre staff.
- Latecomers to a training session may not enter the mat area without the permission of the coach running the session. Permission should also be requested before leaving the dojo while a session is underway.
- Under no circumstances should anyone using the dojo walk from or return to the changing rooms without adequate footwear which should be removed and left in the corridor before entering.
- Both the dojo itself and the judo mats (tatami) should be treated with respect and kept clean tidy and in good condition. Under no circumstances may mats be moved from their position in the dojo.
- Members must remember that the dojo is shared with other martial arts clubs who have priority use at scheduled times.
- No alcohol, sweets, gum, or drinks (other than water bottles) may be brought into the dojo.
- At the end of each session, instructors must ensure that mats are left clean and (except when the dojo is immediately occupied by another martial arts club) that all windows are closed, that heaters and lights have been switched off, the door properly closed, and the key returned to the Sports Centre administration desk.
