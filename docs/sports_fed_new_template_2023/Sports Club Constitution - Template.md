3. If there is a national governing body for the sport with which the Club is eligible to register, the Club shall affect and maintain such registration; purchase any insurance cover which the national body makes available and make every effort to comply with all safety procedures which the national body prescribes or recommends as good practice.

Both the Policy and the procedure for risk assessment must be acceptable to and approved by the Sports Safety Officer. If and for so long as the Club is responsible for organising an inter-college competition, the Policy shall include guidelines and appropriate generic risk assessments for that competition.
